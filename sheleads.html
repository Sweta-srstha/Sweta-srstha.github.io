                        <p class="info">
                            Women elected for the first time in decades faced
                            barriers in leadership, communication, and
                            governance due to societal norms and the pandemic.
                            The challenge was to create a clear, inclusive, and
                            engaging design experience that supported their
                            learning journey and built their confidence in
                            leadership roles. Many came from underrepresented
                            communities like Dalits. Clear, culturally aware
                            design was needed to engage and empower them
                            effectively, even during a pandemic.

                            Through human-centered design principles, we helped
                            transform complex political structures, leadership
                            theories, and gender inclusion topics into visually
                            clear, interactive, and culturally appropriate
                            materials. We adapted rapidly to COVID-19 realities,
                            ensuring that training could continue both virtually
                            and safely on-site. Visual storytelling, simplified

                    <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                    <p class="subtitle__info">
                        After Nepal’s historic 2017 local elections, more than
                        14,000 women, including 7,000 Dalit women were elected
                        to public office, many stepping into leadership for the
                        first time. Recognizing the urgent need for support, She
                        Leads Nepal was launched by the International Foundation
                        for Electoral Systems (IFES) in partnership with the
                        Center for Dalit Women Nepal (CDWN). The project aimed
                        to strengthen the capacity of newly elected women
                        representatives especially Dalit and marginalized women
                        to meaningfully participate in local decision-making and
                        lead with confidence.

                        <h3>Getting Started</h3>
                        <p class="subtitle__info">
                            She Leads Nepal emerged as a powerful response to
                            the 2017 local elections in Nepal, which saw a
                            groundbreaking number of over 14,000 women step into
                            local government roles, many for the first time. The
                            program aimed to transform these women’s roles from
                            passive representatives to active decision-makers in
                            governance, focusing particularly on women from
                            Dalit and marginalized communities. As a Product
                            Designer, I was excited to contribute to this
                            historic initiative by creating visually engaging
                            and culturally sensitive learning materials. My work
                            involved designing easy-to-understand visual assets,
                            developing illustrated governance guides, and
                            crafting interactive worksheets that covered
                            essential leadership skills such as resilience,
                            public speaking, and decision-making. With the onset
                            of the COVID-19 pandemic, I also played a key role
                            in adapting these materials to ensure they were
                            accessible and relevant in a remote learning
                            environment. Collaborating with trainers and senior
                            designers, we ensured the materials were not only
                            informative but also inclusive, helping these women
                            build the confidence and knowledge necessary to
                            embrace their new leadership roles.

                        In the ideation and concept development phase for She
                        Leads Nepal, we brainstormed and explored various ideas
                        to address the specific needs of women aspiring to
                        leadership positions. By collaborating as a team, we
                        generated multiple concepts and refined them based on
                        user feedback and feasibility. This helped us identify
                        the most impactful features and solutions, which we then
                        developed into a clear concept for the platform,
                        ensuring it aligned with both user needs and project
                        goals.

                        In designing the illustrations, we focused on
                        representing a wide range of women leaders from diverse
                        backgrounds, including different ages, ethnicities, and
                        abilities. This was done to foster inclusivity and help
                        participants see themselves reflected in the materials.
                        The illustrations highlighted women in various
                        leadership roles, showcasing their strength, resilience,
                        and potential. By using diverse imagery, we ensured that
                        the materials resonated with the participants and
                        empowered them to step into their leadership roles with
                        confidence.

                            highlight representation, and build emotional
                            connection with participants and audiences. The

                                during COVID-19.

                        <li>
                            472 elected women representatives completed the full
                            first round of training with improved leadership,

                        </li>

                    <h3>Reflections</h3>
                    <p class="subtitle__info">
                        Contributing to She Leads Nepal was a deeply meaningful
                        experience that strengthened my commitment to
                        human-centered, inclusive design. It taught me the power
                        of design not just as a tool for education, but as a
                        catalyst for social transformation. I learned how to
                        collaborate across international teams, design for
                        marginalized communities, and ensure that accessibility,
                        cultural sensitivity, and resilience are embedded into
                        every touchpoint. I learned to design not just for
                        screens, but for real-world learning experiences
                        ensuring that accessibility, clarity, cultural empathy,
                        and user empowerment stayed at the heart of every design
                        decision.
