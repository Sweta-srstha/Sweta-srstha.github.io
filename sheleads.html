                    In designing the illustrations, we focused on representing a
                    wide range of women leaders from diverse backgrounds,
                    including different ages, ethnicities, and abilities. This
                    was done to foster inclusivity and help participants see
                    themselves reflected in the materials. The illustrations
                    highlighted women in various leadership roles, showcasing
                    their strength, resilience, and potential. By using diverse
                    imagery, we ensured that the materials resonated with the
                    participants and empowered them to step into their
                    leadership roles with confidence.

                <p class="overview-details">
                    As part of the “She Leads” training program in Nepal, I
                    designed a set of visual assets that helped bring the
                    program’s goals and impact to life. These visuals were
                    created to strengthen communication, highlight
                    representation, and build emotional connection with
                    participants and audiences.
                </p>
                <p class="overview-details">The assets were used across:</p>
                <ul class="overview-list">
                    <li>
                        Training materials, where scenes depicted real-life
                        challenges like navigating governance during COVID-19.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Community assignments, helping representatives
                        communicate with local citizens about safety and
                        inclusion.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Promotional and storytelling content, visually
                        reinforcing the message that women from all
                        backgrounds—Dalit, disabled, elderly, rural—belong in
                        leadership.
                    </li>
                    <p class="overview-details">
                        Each image captures a specific moment or message.
                        Through thoughtful composition, expressive body
                        language, and inclusive representation, the
                        illustrations helped bring the program’s core values to
                        life.

                    <p class="overview-details red">
                        “My goal was to create visuals that felt grounded,
                        human, and representative something participants could
                        see themselves in and feel proud of.”

                    Contributing to She Leads Nepal was a deeply meaningful
                    experience that strengthened my commitment to
                    human-centered, inclusive design. It taught me the power of
                    design not just as a tool for education, but as a catalyst
                    for social transformation. I learned how to collaborate
                    across international teams, design for marginalized
                    communities, and ensure that accessibility, cultural
                    sensitivity, and resilience are embedded into every
                    touchpoint. I learned to design not just for screens, but
                    for real-world learning experiences ensuring that
                    accessibility, clarity, cultural empathy, and user
                    empowerment stayed at the heart of every design decision.
