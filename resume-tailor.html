                            Resume Tailor is an
                            <strong>AI-assisted</strong> resume builder designed
                            to help users create personalized, job-specific
                            resumes quickly and confidently. As an Alumni, I was
                            part of a team of skilled students contracted by our
                            university to develop this platform. It supports
                            users in three ways: creating resumes from scratch,
                            uploading existing ones for editing, and tailoring
                            resumes based on job descriptions using AI
                            suggestions. Though initially built for students, it
                            serves anyone looking to craft effective, targeted
                            resumes.

                        <p class="overview-details">
                            Many job seekers rely on a single generic resume,
                            reducing their chances in competitive markets.
                            Research showed users struggle to tailor resumes due
                            to lack of clarity and rigid, complex
                            toolsâ€”especially first-time applicants. Resume
                            Tailor addresses this by offering a simple,
                            flexible, and intelligent way to create targeted,
                            professional resumes with ease.

                            user-centered approach. I supported user research,
                            helped define key user flows, and designed

                            needs. Collaborating closely with teammates through
                            tools like Figma, FigJam, Miro, and Slack, I worked

                    department, I created a resume tailoring platform that
                    helped students quickly generate job-specific resumes with
                    confidence and clarity. The solution included AI-powered
                    parsing of job descriptions, smart resume templates, and a
                    real-time editing experience tailored to both student needs
                    and recruiter expectations.

                <p class="overview-details">
                    The result was a product that didnâ€™t just meet academic
                    goals it made a measurable impact on studentsâ€™ career
                    readiness and became a valuable tool officially adopted by
                    the university.

                    This project was a meaningful opportunity as an Alumni to
                    design a tool for real students, hosted on the universityâ€™s
                    servers. Balancing simplicity and flexibility was a key
                    challenge, ensuring students could tailor resumes easily
                    without feeling overwhelmed. Collaborating with career
                    advisors and students gave valuable insights and validated
                    our design choices.

                    Seeing the platform become part of the universityâ€™s career
                    services highlighted the impact of user-centered design.
                    This experience strengthened my UX, collaboration, and
