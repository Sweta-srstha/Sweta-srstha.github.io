                            During my research, I realized that many property
                            search platforms were frustrating to use. Listings
                            were often cluttered, filters didnâ€™t work properly,
                            and mobile experiences were especially poor. Users
                            also struggled to keep track of their favorite
                            properties or easily get in touch with agents. I
                            wanted to solve these problems by designing an

                            helpful making the property search process smoother
                            and less stressful.

                                    ><br />
                                    Designing for mobile first taught me to
                                    focus on the essentials, ensuring clarity
                                    and functionality in smaller spaces before
                                    scaling up for larger screens.

                                    Creating designs for multiple breakpoints
                                    helped me understand how to adapt layouts
                                    and elements for various devices,
                                    maintaining consistency and usability.

                    Next, I plan to refine the visual design to make it more
                    polished and consistent. I will work on creating
                    high-fidelity prototypes to showcase interactions and ensure
                    the user journey feels smooth. I also want to expand the
                    designs for more breakpoints and conduct usability testing
                    to gather feedback and make further improvements based on
                    real user insights.
