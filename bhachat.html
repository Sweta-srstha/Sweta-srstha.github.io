                            Managing personal finances can feel overwhelming
                            many users struggle to track spending, transfer
                            money quickly, or trust digital platforms. Bhachat
                            was created to address these needs through
                            thoughtful design focused on clarity, security, and
                            simplicity.

                            I started Bhachat after realizing how many people,
                            including myself, struggle to manage their finances
                            with existing digital tools. Many budgeting apps
                            feel overly complex and lack trust. Even simple
                            tasks like tracking expenses or sending money can be
                            frustrating.
                        </p>
                        <p class="overview-details">
                            But this goes beyond bad UX when people can’t manage
                            their money confidently, it leads to overspending,
                            missed payments, and stress. I wondered: What if a
                            financial app truly worked for everyday people?
                            Something simple, secure, and genuinely helpful.
                            That question sparked Bhachat.

                        To understand what users truly need from an e-wallet
                        app, I conducted interviews and surveys with 25

                            Users want a clear way to see where their money

                    After completing user research, I began designing
                    low-fidelity wireframes by translating insights—especially
                    from the card sorting exercise—into a simple visual layout.
                    This helped prioritize user needs and ensured a clear,
                    intuitive flow through the app’s core features. Building on
                    that foundation, I then created mid-fidelity wireframes,
                    which added more structure and detail to the layout,
                    including spacing and element placement. These wireframes
                    incorporated feedback from the initial designs to refine
                    usability and served as a bridge between the basic sketches
                    and the final high-fidelity design.

                    labels; the “This Year” time filter was often missed some
                    transaction icons like “Miscellaneous” were unclear and the
                    bottom navigation icons were confusing without text. These
                    issues affected user understanding and ease of navigation.

                <p class="overview-details">
                    Solution: I improved chart clarity by adding legends and
                    value labels, made the time filter more prominent and
                    interactive with better visual hierarchy, replaced vague
                    icons with intuitive visuals and sub-labels, and enhanced
                    navigation by adding descriptive text under each icon. These
                    refinements led to a clearer, more user-friendly experience.

                    Issue: Users were confused by the inconsistency between the
                    two sign-up screens. The left screen asked for “Full Name”
                    and “Mobile/Email,” while the right screen required “Email”
                    and “Username,” causing uncertainty about what credentials
                    were required. Additionally, some users missed the social
                    login options or overlooked the “Log in” link due to low
                    visual hierarchy and spacing.
                </p>

                <p class="overview-details">
                    Solution:I standardized the input fields across both screens
                    to ensure consistent onboarding expectations. Labels were
                    aligned, and placeholder text was made more informative. I
                    also enhanced the visibility of social login buttons by
                    improving spacing and contrast, and made the "Log in" link
                    more prominent to support returning users.

                    Issue: Users found it confusing to manage multiple cards,
                    especially when only one card was prominently displayed at a
                    time (left screen). During testing, users expressed the need
                    to quickly switch between cards and manage them efficiently.
                </p>

                <p class="overview-details">
                    Solution:To resolve this, I redesigned the card section to
                    display cards in a horizontal scrollable carousel (right
                    screen), allowing users to swipe through their cards easily.
                    This provided better visibility and control over multiple
                    cards while maintaining a clean and user-friendly interface.

                    Working on Bhachat was a valuable experience, allowing me to
                    explore user-centric design in the fintech space. I focused
                    on creating a seamless and intuitive app that simplifies
                    financial management, addresses user pain points, and
                    enhances overall usability.

                    gather user feedback and refine the app's functionality for
