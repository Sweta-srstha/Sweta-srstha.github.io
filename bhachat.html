                        In todayâ€™s busy world, managing finances can be
                        overwhelming. Users face challenges with tracking
                        balances, managing transactions, and making payments
                        conveniently and securely. Bhachat aims to simplify
                        financial management by providing an easy-to-use mobile
                        e-wallet app that helps users track their balance,
                        manage transactions, and make payments effortlessly.

                    <p class="subtitle__info">
                        Designing Bhachat, a user-friendly e-wallet app, began
                        with research and user insights to understand key needs
                        like security, finance management and seamless
                        transactions. I started by creating wireframes and
                        prototypes in Figma, ensuring an intuitive and
                        accessible user experience. With a focus on clean design
                        and smooth navigation, I incorporated essential features
                        such as two-factor authentication, quick fund transfers,
                        and budget tracking. Through usability testing and
                        iteration, I refined the design to enhance usability and
                        efficiency, making Bhachat a reliable and secure
                        financial management solution.

                        I began working on the low-fidelity wireframes after
                        completing the user research. Using the insights gained
                        from the card sorting exercise, I translated the refined
                        sitemap into a simple visual layout that prioritizes
                        user needs and ensures a clear, intuitive flow through
                        the app's core features.

                    <p class="subtitle__info">
                        After completing the low-fidelity wireframes, I moved on
                        to creating mid-fidelity wireframes. These wireframes
                        add more detail and structure, focusing on the layout,
                        spacing, and placement of elements, while still
                        maintaining a focus on usability. By incorporating
                        feedback from the initial designs, I aimed to create a
                        more polished and functional representation of the app's
                        key features, bridging the gap between the basic outline
                        and the final high-fidelity design

                            Once the Bhachat prototype was complete, I conducted
                            usability testing to identify and address any user
                            experience issues. I developed a test plan and
                            recruited 8 participants to perform 5 specific
                            tasks. Using affinity mapping and a rainbow
                            spreadsheet, I analyzed the results to pinpoint
                            usability problems and gather valuable feedback.
                            This process allowed me to refine the prototype and
                            enhance the overall design.

                    <h3>Reflection</h3>
                    <p class="subtitle__info">
                        Working on Bhachat was a valuable experience, allowing
                        me to explore user-centric design in the fintech space.
                        I focused on creating a seamless and intuitive app that
                        simplifies financial management, addresses user pain
                        points, and enhances overall usability.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Next steps</h3>
                    <p class="subtitle__info">
                        Moving forward, I aim to implement features like savings
                        goals, enhanced budget analytics, and multi-language
                        support. I also plan to conduct further usability tests
                        to gather user feedback and refine the app's
                        functionality for a more robust user experience.
