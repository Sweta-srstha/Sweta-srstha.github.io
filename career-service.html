                            Career Service Center (CSC) is a digital platform
                            developed to close the gap between academic learning
                            and real-world job readiness in Nepal. It combines
                            self-assessment tools, job-role-specific training,
                            and direct access to internships and employment
                            opportunities offering a unified experience for

                        <p class="overview-details">
                            In Nepal, graduates often leave university
                            unprepared for real-world jobs, while employers
                            struggle to find skilled, job-ready talent. There
                            was no single platform that combined skill-building,
                            self-assessment, and job placement in a localized,
                            user-friendly way. Employers struggle to find
                            candidates who are prepared for real-world
                            responsibilities, while students lack resources to
                            develop those skills outside the classroom. Existing
                            solutions were fragmented and inaccessible. CSC was
                            created to solve this disconnect by offering a
                            centralized, job-readiness platform tailored to the
                            local context.

                    Working on CSC gave me the opportunity to design for real
                    social impact. I learned how to navigate government and
                    educational constraints, balance local accessibility needs,
                    and create scalable systems used at a national level. If I
                    could revisit this project, I would incorporate gamification
                    in skill progression and explore SMS-based notifications for
                    users in low-connectivity areas.
