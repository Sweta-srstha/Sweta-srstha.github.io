                            Career Service Center (CSC) is a digital platform
                            developed to close the gap between academic learning
                            and real-world job readiness in Nepal. It combines
                            self-assessment tools, job-role-specific training,
                            and direct access to internships and employment
                            opportunities offering a unified experience for
                            students, employers, and educational institutions.

                        <p class="overview-details">
                            Graduates in Nepal frequently leave university
                            without the skills needed for real-world jobs, while
                            employers face difficulty finding job-ready talent.
                            Existing solutions are fragmented and fail to
                            provide a unified, accessible platform for
                            skill-building, self-assessment, and job placement
                            tailored to local needs. CSC was created to solve
                            this disconnect by offering a centralized,
                            job-readiness platform tailored to the local
                            context.

                            requirements and priorities. I conducted user

                <p class="overview-details">
                    After thoroughly analyzing user research and feedback, we
                    identified key design goals to directly tackle the
                    challenges students and employers face in bridging the
                    academic-industry gap. These goals guided us in developing
                    focused features for Career Service Center, ensuring an
                    engaging, user-friendly platform that effectively supports
                    skill development, self-assessment, and job matching to
                    better prepare students for the workforce.

                <p class="overview-details">
                    Working on CSC gave me the opportunity to design for real
                    social impact. I learned how to navigate government and
                    educational constraints, balance local accessibility needs,
                    and create scalable systems used at a national level. If I
                    could revisit this project, I would incorporate gamification
                    in skill progression and explore SMS-based notifications for
                    users in low-connectivity areas.
